**Extended Kalman Filter Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Implement the Extended Kalman Filter for fusing the Lidar and Radar measurements to estimate the position of a tracked object from the car.
*

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/513/view) Points
### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

All the code for this project has been obtained from the example code in the course and is in this directory.

### Extended Kalman Filter

#### 1. Prediction from the motion

### Discussion

#### 8. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

I was able to get the error within the specified limits for both the example runs.
